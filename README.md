# Indigo Deployment

The following steps describe how to deploy indigo to a remote (or local) server.

[ Note, if you intend to run multiple servers, know beforehand the details of
the networks, as it is best to set up the system with the 'real' network rather
than using localhost. ]

####  PREREQUISTES
Ansible expects a user _indigo_ to exist with sudo rights.  
e.g. 

```
sudo adduser  indigo
sudo usermod -G sudo,adm indigo
 # If you want to propagate ssh certificates
sudo mkdir ~indigo/.ssh
sudo cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys >> ~indigo/.ssh/authorized_keys 
```

#### Access

* Make sure you have access to the server via SSH

#### Pre-requisites

-- Install Ansible and GIT on the host from which you are installing (not the 
target).

```
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install ansible git
```
-- Fetch _this_ package
```
git clone https://github.com/pericles-project/ERMR.git
```

#### Configuration

* By default the user account on the server should be 'indigo' who should have 
sudo access.  If different then the user field in deploy-standalone.yml should 
be changed.

* Cassandra stores it data by default in /var/lib/cassandra -- this may be 
redirected to an appropriate storage volume, either via a symbolic link or 
using something like
```
mkdir /var/lib/cassandra
mount --bind <target> /var/lib/cassandra
mkdir /var/lib/cassandra/data
#Â Ensure that permissions and ownership are appropriately set
chown -R casssandra:cassandra /var/lib/cassandra
```

* Create a ```hosts``` file containing the IP address of the servers.  It should look like..

```
[indigo-databases]
192.168.20.20 cassandra_interface=eth0

[indigo-webservers]
192.168.20.20

[indigo:children]
indigo-databases
indigo-webservers
```

Where the IP addresses should be replaced with the host name/IP address of each 
machine. For each [indigo-databases] you must provide the Ethernet interface on 
which Cassandra communicates. Usually this is eth0, but it may be something 
different on more complex topologies.

* The default behavior is to use HTTPS. If needed this can be changed in the
webservers.yml file with the variable https_mode. The nginx server is using the
SSL certificate in /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt. If they are not present a self-signed
version is created during deployment.

* The deployment is configured to use upstart by default. If you need to use
systemd there's a script that can be used and deployed during install. This is
commented in the main.yml task for indigo-web and indigo-listener role.

#### Deploying


Run the deployment with the following command:

```
ansible-playbook deploy_standalone.yml -i hosts --ask-become-pass
```

This command is used to deploy ERMR on a test server named loc-ermr 
(see staging/staging)

```
ansible-playbook deploy_standalone.yml -i staging/staging --ask-become-pass
```

* Once started the script will ask for some details. The sudo-password for the 
user specified in deploy-standalone.yml.
